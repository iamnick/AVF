			<h2>Week 2 Research</h2>
			<p><strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong></p>
			<p>For my demo app, I could improve the accessibility by adding semantic tags to better define the sections of my pages. On my API pages in particular, I used h tags for some of my labels and text, which I should probably change to span or label tags and format them with CSS instead.</p>
			<p><strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong></p>
			<p>One of the most common frustrations people who use screen readers have is a poorly structured site that is hard for the individual to make sense of because of what the screen reader returns. To fix this, sites should be laid out in a way that makes sense. Semantic tags should be used, and used properly, to label each section of the page. Sites should also try to avoid using excessive amounts of links, as a page with hundreds of links can be daunting to a user with a screen reader.</p>
			<p><strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
			<p>I think most of the newer smartphones and tablets are designed to support accessibility. The iPhone for example has a built in screen reader called VoiceOver, FaceTime so that individuals with hearing impairments can communicate via sign language, and even Siri could be considered an accessibility feature. Newer Android phones also have screen readers built-in, as well as other accessibility features like vibration and sound feedback which lets you assign patterns of each to certain actions on your phone.</p>
			<p><strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
			<p>An app that I found for iOS is LookTel Money Reader, which uses the deviceâ€™s camera to identify the denomination of currency for a visually impaired individual. Another app I found for iOS is Color ID Free, which also uses the camera to get the exact color of something. This could be useful to individuals who are colorblind.</p>
