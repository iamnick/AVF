			<h2>Week 1 Research</h2>
			<p><strong>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong></p>
			<p>There are already lots of sites, services, and games out there that give an option to login through Facebook, and doing so with Twitter would be similar. Logging in through your social media account would make it easier for the user, since there wouldn’t be a new account/password to keep track of. Users could also easily share things from the site/service/game easily as well via their social media account since the two would be connected already. Similarly, you could make payments by logging into your Twitter account too and using your information stored there.</p>
			<p><strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong></p>
			<p>We need to use JSON-P to get around the same origin policy, since our apps would be requesting data from a different domain than the server it’s located on.</p>
			<p><strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong></p>
			<p>I think many of the social media APIs would be great with the camera, as sharing photos and video is something most people like to do. These APIs could also pair well with the geo location.</p>
			<p><strong>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</strong></p>
			<p>For my demo app this month, I’d like to demo as many native features as I can in some way just to learn how to access and use them all. In particular, I’m interested in using the accelerometer as I think tilting and moving the device to do things is pretty cool.</p>
			<p><strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong></p>
			<p>I’ve learned a lot of things from previous months while working on projects in regards to workflow.  I’ve learned to look ahead at the end goal of what we’re trying to accomplish, as it really helps to plan the steps in between to get things done efficiently. I’ve also learned to plan on spending extra time on things, since I almost always seem to run into unexpected issues working on each project.</p>
