			<h2>Week 3 Research</h2>
			<p><strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</strong></p>
			<p>Games are the top sellers in each of the 3 regions.</p>
			<p><strong>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</strong></p>
			<p>Games are an app type that’s always going to be popular. Many smartphone users fall in a younger age demographic, which probably are more likely to be interested in games. Smartphone users are also looking for things to do in their constant small breaks throughout the day, and games fit this perfectly.</p>
			<p><strong>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</strong></p>
			<p>Average Internet upload/download speed and costs for each region:<br/><br/>
            	United States – 15.50mbps/4.00mbps, $36/month<br/>
				Japan – 36.82mbps/15.92mbps, $49/month<br/>
				Great Britain – 19.29mbps/3.50mbps, $33/month<br/><br/>
				While the US and UK are similar in their speeds and costs, Japan has vastly higher speeds and slightly higher costs. When developing apps targeted at the Japanese market (or most Asian markets really, most of them have much faster speeds compared to the Western world), you can design things that are heavier on resources like video and graphics because of their faster speeds.</p>
			<p><strong>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</strong></p>
			<p>My project topic would be a game designed for a Western market, as they are the biggest game users. However, a well-designed game is something that can be enjoyed by cultures everywhere as well, as seen by examples such as Angry Birds. Designing something for the lower speed Western market would also ensure that it runs everywhere, whereas something resource-heavy that was designed for a high speed connection in Asia wouldn’t be as usable by the rest of the world.</p>
